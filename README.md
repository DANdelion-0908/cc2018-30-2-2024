# Software Rendering - 01 -Point

## Objective

- Understand the basics of computer graphics.
- Implement a framebuffer class in Rust.
- Implement a BMP class to write a BMP file.
- Draw points and output the result as a BMP file.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/menene/cc2018-30-2-2024.git
